# sqlalchemy-challenge
Please note that I unceromoniusly made a mistake using Visual Studio Code, where I unknowingly staged a bunch of commits. Later as I pushed the first stage of my homework to the folder, I learned the concequences of my actions as the git push effectively cloned my local directory into my repository. 
nearly 300 commits later, I have removed a large portion of those files, unfortunately due to time constraints, not all.
Please excuse the clutter and once you finally stop laughing at this poor student blunder, find the necessary files for my homework assignment.
